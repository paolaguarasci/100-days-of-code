The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on 21 May 2018


## Log
This is my first round with this challenge!


### R1D1
I start whit beta path on freeCodeCamp RWB. Just for review the basic!


###Â R1D2
I just found out about beta.freecodecamp.org there is no trace of my progress yesterday!
~~Obviously, it's in beta yet!~~
~~I continue with the review, anyway: *CSS and JS basic*.~~
I have switch to stable curriculum.
Continue my last run:
-4 challenge to claim the front end certificate.


### R1D3
**I'm stuck on minimax algorithm.** I need it for one of the last challenges on my
path, "Tic Tac Toe". I'm tried doing this in C++ first because my JS is little confusing at the moment.
In fact, i decided to review my JS knowledge.
