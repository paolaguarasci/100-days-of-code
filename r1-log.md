## Log
This is my first round with this challenge!

### R1D1
I start whit beta path on freeCodeCamp RWB. Just for review the basic!

###Â R1D2
I just found out about beta.freecodecamp.org there is no trace of my progress yesterday!
Obviously, it's in beta yet!
I continue with the review, anyway: *CSS and JS basic*.
